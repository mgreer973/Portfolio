			<p>I have many years of development experience but only recently have I become a web developer. I feel I can give my new users what I have given my users in the past not only what they want but what they need. I pride myself in being a good team player. 
			I feel I can bring alot both to within the organization and without. I'm a trekkie and have always liked things dealing with the future. I also like to learn new things I can go on the internet and keep going from one page to another for hours sometimes forgetting to eat. I also like sports football, baseball and basketball have watched or played each. </p>
